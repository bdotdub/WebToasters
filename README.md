Web Toasters is a simple Mac OS X screensaver that will allow you to make any
into a screensaver. Really, that's kind of it.


Getting Web Toasters
--------------------

You can get the source by cloning it from Github:

    $ git clone git://github.com/bdotdub/WebToasters.git

Or you can just download the built screensaver:

    http://github.com/downloads/bdotdub/WebToasters/WebToasters.saver.latest.zip


Installing Web Toasters
-----------------------

If you are trying to install from source, I think you know enough to be able
to install it after you build it in Xcode

From the zip file, double click to unzip it. And then double click on the
"WebToasters.saver" file and it should install onto your computer


To Change the Webpage
---------------------

Go to `System Preferences`, then `Desktop & Screen Saver`. In the
`Screen Saver` tab, look for the `WebToasters` screensaver.

Once you select it, you can click on the `Options` button to change the URL of
the webpage that you want.
